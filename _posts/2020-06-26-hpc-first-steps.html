        This is just a quick post to highlight a new section: <a href="/hpc">High-Performance Computing</a>.  Concepts here deal with
        handling and efficient processing of large data sets.  Most of the demos will rely heavily
        on the intermingling of <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>, Python, and Javascript.
        Rust and/or C++ may make an appearance in later sections as they are utilized.

        The first two demos include:
        <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
            <li>GCD - This is a simple section to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. I don't believe there's a limit on integer size. Both are validated, so entering text or a floating-point value should produce an error.</li>
            <li>Julia set - Here we have a fractal generation demo.  The initial static size is 256 iterations (2^8)</li>
        </ul>
